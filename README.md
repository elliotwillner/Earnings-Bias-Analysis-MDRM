# Earnings-Bias-Analysis-MDRM

The goal of this replication study is to explore the bias surrounding genders of executives in earnings calls. We will be using a multimodal deep regression model with text and audio data.

When verbal and vocal features are available in addition to text data, considering them is important because the vocal cues can either affirm or discredit certain words, phrases, and messages. For example, pauses or pitch differences could imply that an executive may think something differently from what they say.
